# MYX215A - myxfitness table

This project was to try and root the Tablet. Unfortunately, I am at a standstill with this and wanted to post my research. Here are some relevant links and hardware specs.

The instructions in the link below are incorrect. You need to press and hold the Volume Up and Power button for 5 seconds to get into recovery and 10 to get into the chinese diagnostics. I could not find any board firmware or motherboard information.
